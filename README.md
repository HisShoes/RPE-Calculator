Basic RPE calculator to help with workouts, input weight lifted, reps performed and RPE for a set and see what your estimated max is and what % of that max the lift was.

Extra Todos once the above is working:
* Ability to record multiple sets
* Show a table of weights for RPE's/Sets based on estimated rep max (so that you can see if your e1rm is 100kg, what weight you should put on to do x3 @ 7)
* Add the type of lift to the set
* Record data in a database somewhere + be able to load past workouts
