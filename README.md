Built with React and Redux, using Jest & Enzyme for unit tests. TDD approach used.

RPE (Rated Perceived Exertion) is a scale of 1 to 10 used when exercising to judge how difficult a set was, track progress and figure out what weight should be used for remaining sets.

This is a basic RPE calculator to help with workouts, input weight lifted, reps performed and RPE for a set and see what your estimated max is and what % of that max the lift was.

Extra Todos once the above is working:
* Ability to record multiple sets
* Show a table of weights for RPE's/Sets based on estimated rep max (so that you can see if your e1rm is 100kg, what weight you should put on to do x3 @ 7)
* Add the type of lift to the set
* Record data in a database somewhere + be able to load past workouts
